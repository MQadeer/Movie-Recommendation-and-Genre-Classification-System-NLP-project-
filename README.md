# Methodology Deviations: Proposal vs Implementation Analysis

## Key Deviations from Original Proposal

### 1. Machine Learning Algorithm Change

| Aspect | Proposal | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Algorithm | Logistic Regression | Linear Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC) |
| Strategy | One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression | One-vs-Rest LinearSVC |

**Reasoning for Change:**

- **Better Performance**: SVM typically outperforms logistic regression on high-dimensional sparse text data
- **Robustness**: LinearSVC is specifically optimized for text classification tasks
- **Class Imbalance**: class_weight='balanced' parameter in SVM handles imbalanced genre distribution better than standard logistic regression
- **Scalability**: LinearSVC scales better with large vocabulary sizes common in NLP tasks
- **Research Evidence**: Literature shows SVM often achieves superior results for multi-label text classification

### 2. Feature Extraction Enhancement

| Aspect | Proposal | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Method | TF-IDF only | TF-IDF + Sentence Embeddings (dual approach) |
| Approach | Traditional bag-of-words | Modern transformer-based embeddings |

**Reasoning for Enhancement:**

- **Semantic Understanding**: Sentence embeddings capture semantic meaning beyond keyword matching
- **State-of-the-Art**: Transformer models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) represent current best practices in NLP
- **Better Representations**: Dense embeddings often outperform sparse TF-IDF for similarity tasks
- **Flexibility**: Code allows switching between traditional and modern approaches
- **Future-Proofing**: Embedding approach is more aligned with current NLP trends

### 3. Recommendation System Implementation

| Aspect | Proposal | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Method | Cosine Similarity on TF-IDF | Nearest Neighbors with Cosine Metric |
| Computation | Manual similarity computation | Scikit-learn's optimized NearestNeighbors |

**Reasoning for Change:**

- **Efficiency**: NearestNeighbors is highly optimized for similarity search
- **Scalability**: Better performance on large datasets
- **Flexibility**: Can easily change distance metrics or number of neighbors
- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids computing full pairwise similarity matrix
- **Industry Standard**: More commonly used in production recommendation systems

### 4. Preprocessing Simplification

| Aspect | Proposal | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Pipeline | Complex preprocessing pipeline | Streamlined preprocessing |
| Focus | Lemmatization/Stemming emphasis | Focus on lemmatization only |
| Implementation | Manual implementation | NLTK-based implementation |

**Reasoning for Simplification:**

- **Diminishing Returns**: Extensive preprocessing often provides minimal improvement
- **Embedding Robustness**: Modern embeddings are more robust to preprocessing variations
- **Speed**: Faster processing pipeline for real-time applications
- **Maintainability**: Simpler code is easier to debug and maintain

## Justifications for Each Change

### 1. Why LinearSVM over Logistic Regression?

**Technical Advantages:**

- **Margin Maximization**: SVM finds optimal decision boundary with maximum margin
- **Kernel Trick Potential**: Easy to extend to non-linear kernels if needed
- **Sparse Data Handling**: Excellent performance on high-dimensional sparse text data
- **Regularization**: Built-in regularization prevents overfitting

**Empirical Evidence:**

- Text classification benchmarks consistently show SVM outperforming logistic regression
- Better handling of class imbalance through balanced class weights
- More stable performance across different dataset sizes

### 2. Why Add Sentence Embeddings?

**Semantic Advantages:**

- **Context Awareness**: Understands word relationships and sentence meaning
- **Synonym Handling**: Similar words are mapped to similar vector spaces
- **Narrative Understanding**: Better captures plot themes and narrative elements

**Practical Benefits:**

- **Recommendation Quality**: More meaningful movie similarities
- **Genre Classification**: Better identification of thematic elements
- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to vocabulary variations

### 3. Why NearestNeighbors over Manual Cosine Similarity?

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Uses optimized search algorithms (KD-tree, Ball-tree)
- **Memory Management**: Doesn't require storing full similarity matrix
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently

**Implementation Advantages:**

- **Flexibility**: Easy to experiment with different similarity metrics
- **Integration**: Better integration with scikit-learn ecosystem
- **Maintenance**: Less custom code to maintain and debug
